This project provides tools for manipulating [ECCAIRS](https://eccairsportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=2)  taxonomies. 

In particular it serves to:
- parse ECCAIRS Taxonomy distribution
- parse RIT Taxonomy distribution
- comparison of ECCAIRS and RIT versions
- (experimental) export of ECCAIRS into SNOMED format
